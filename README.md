# 🧠 AI Kit – Cost Savings Estimator

This project uses machine learning to estimate monthly cost savings in the textile industry based on weather conditions, production quantities, water, and electricity usage. It aims to support sustainable practices by helping manufacturers forecast savings from water reuse and solar energy efficiency.

## 📊 Overview

Textile production consumes large amounts of water and electricity. This tool uses AI to:
- Predict cost savings from water reuse
- Estimate solar (PV) output based on weather scores
- Visualize resource relationships
- Provide a user-friendly Streamlit interface
